Use the Hypotext shortcodes to format your articles into a reader friendly format.

== Description ==

Click to expand. Click to contract. Reveal additional content on-demand with our simple shortcode.

Traditional article formats present the reader with all of the article content in a linear view.
This often results in the reader not reading the article, or not being able to find the information
they were looking for. Hypotext allows a skeleton article to be created with the supporting content
being available inline, when the user clicks the "hypotext" link in the article.
